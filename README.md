**Intro**
  
This project includes the 4-6 projects from Practicum. All the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes . This project features modal box, media query, flexbox. This project includes card elements rendered through javascript using template tags through HTML. The page is responsive through desktop and mobile. The project includes functionality to add images and titles and utilize the add button and add/remove card images. In addition it includes clicking the like button with a fillin mechanic and fade in/out feature with the modal boxes. The project has a smooth opening and closing feature of the modal box. Validation on the modal boxes let users add the required characters to operate the fields to write the proper name and description. The error messages will appear if the field the user enters is invalid and this tells the user to follow the procedures to overcome the error messages.

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.
